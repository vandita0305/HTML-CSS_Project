        </div>
        
        <p>t a distance of only 15 km from Pahalgam is Chandanwari, a glacier point and the starting point of the sacred Amarnath Yatra. Located at an elevation, it’s an offbeat destination to stop and have breakfast in the lap of nature. After a 30-minute detour, you can go on with your journey back to Srinagar.</p>
      
        <p>  Spend the night in a houseboat (if you haven’t already) or a hotel in the city and relish a local meal. Try the authentic mutton rogan josh with the traditional bread and finish off with the world-famous Kashmiri phirni for dessert.
